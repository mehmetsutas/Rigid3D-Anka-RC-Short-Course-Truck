Anka is a mostly 3d printed 1/10 RC Short Course Truck which is inspired and remixed from the excellent Tarmo4 project. (You may reach the Tarmo4 project's details from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringNS/).)

If you are a terrible driver like me, this hobby might become a bit expensive. Especially bashers may encounter lots of crashes and breakage which discourages the hobbyist. I wanted to design a basher which is mostly 3d printed so that I can drive it without worrying about crashes and breaks. I enjoy bashing more since I don't have to pay for the spares and wait for them to arrive.

The project is named Anka which is the Turkish equivalent of Phoenix from Greek or Simurgh from Persian mythology. After each crash broken parts are reprinted and the truck is reborn as does the immortal Anka which is reborn from its ashes.

In this model you can even print the shock absorbers and tires with TPU filament. But do not expect the performance of oil filled shocks or rubber tires from them.

Most of the parts may be printed with PLA and should work well with 2600KV motor and 2S LIPO battery. The material tested and recommended are shown in the file notes.

It can be printed on small printers. Each part can be fit in a 15x15x15cm (6"x6"x6") build volume.

The truck is designed in the Short Course Truck (SCT) class. It meets the width and wheelbase dimension specifications of ROAR 1/10 Short Course Truck class.

The steering system is designed according to Ackermann geometry.

3d printed open differentials are used on both front and rear differentials.
